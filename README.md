# 🌌 Spiral Constant Path Hypothesis

A testable mathematical and visual model proposing that the Yin-Yang symbol is not just a 2D philosophical icon, but the **cross-section of a spiral-bridged wormhole inside a sphere**.

This repository contains:
- 🌀 A **one-cell Colab notebook** that visualizes the internal spiral path
- 📐 Verified math showing predictable, constant-length spiral behavior
- 🧠 A playful but serious theory: that duality is connected not by a line—but a spiral.

## 🔬 Theory Summary

We hypothesize that:
- The **dots of the Yin-Yang** are **entry and exit points** of a 3D spiral bridge.
- This spiral, modeled as a logarithmic helix, has an **internally consistent path length**.
- The 2D Yin-Yang is the **projection** of this curled structure.
- If true, the Yin-Yang might be the **first symbolic wormhole diagram** in history.

## 📊 Math Foundations

The spiral path is defined by:
```python
r(θ) = r₀ * exp(bθ)
z(θ) = h * θ
```

We compute arc length with:
```
L = ∫ sqrt((dr/dθ)² + r² + (dz/dθ)²) dθ
```

This model has shown:
- Smooth, testable growth patterns
- Length stability across variations
- Realistic geometry under spherical constraints
